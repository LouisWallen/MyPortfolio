# Atomination

This game revolves around placing atoms on a grid-based game board. Each grid space has a limit of how many atoms it can contain. Once the limit is reached, the atoms will expand to the adjacent grid spaces. This simple rule exhibits an interesting property where chains can be triggered by a single placement. This acts as a mechanism to capture other grid spaces from your opponents. The game will be accompanied by a number of utility functions for players to utilise such as saving the game, game statistics and loading games. You will also need to implement a set of commands that will allow the players to interact with the game.

To try the game, execute "Start_AtominationGUI.bat/.sh" in Windows/Linux for Graphical version of the game. For command line version execute "Start_Atomination.bat/.sh" in Windows/Linux.
